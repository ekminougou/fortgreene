<h1>BLOCK: 2702</h1>
<h2>Brooklyn</h2>
<h3>Fort Greene Park</h3>
<p><b>Preliminary findings:</b></p>
<br/>
<p>Fort Green is a primarily residential community that is currently in a development boom. The neighborhood and nearby downtown Brooklyn are popular neighborhoods with many luxury developments springing up. Within Fort Greene there are three historical districts with many landmarked buildings. The historical districs include <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/FortGreene_DR.pdf" target="_blank">Fort Greene</a>, <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/BROOKLYN_ACADEMY_OF_MUSIC_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf" target="_blank">Brooklyn Academy of Music</a>, and <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/wallabout.pdf" target="_blank">Wallabout.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Block 2072 has 37 residential buildings with 9 mixed-use residential/commercial buildings, a transportation/utility building, and a public facility. Overall there are not many complaints for the block. The most complaints are along Myrtle Ave where there is more traffic and a few buisiness, including restaurants. One residential building has an unusual number of violations (54) and complaints (20) between 2014 and 2016. This may indicate that there are disagreements between the landlord and the tenant.
<br/>
<br/>
Near the block and along the north side of the park are NYCHA housing, the Whitman Houses and Ingersoll Houses. The Ingersoll site is currently a site that that is being reviewed by the city for development. An RFP has been issued to develop affordable senior housing on a small lot within the houses, alongside the park. The development should help to address some of the needs of the community and city for affordable senior housing in an increasingly expensive neighborhood.</p>

<h3>About Emily Kerns Minougou</h3>
<p>I am currently completing my masters in Urban Planning at Columbia GSAPP and working tirelessly on my thesis about the spatial assimilation of West African and Chinese immigrants. I like to make maps and learn about new technologies and methods to work with and display data. I also like coffee (COFFEE!), ice cream, walking or running through parks, traveling, and just wandering around the city to see what's new to me.</p>
